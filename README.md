## Getting Started

Thanks for giving me this Opportunity.

1) You can find sample apk in Sample APK folder
2) To build the apk you could use 'flutter build apk' command in the project directory.

◉ There are 2 Models 'Movies' for storing result recieved from Api response and 'StateModel' to manage states and overall state of Application.
